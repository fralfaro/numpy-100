# 100 numpy exercises

This is a collection of numpy exercises from numpy mailing list, stack overflow,
and numpy documentation. I've also created some problems myself to reach the 100 limit.

The goal of this collection is to offer a quick reference 
for both old and new users but also to provide a set of exercises
for those who teach. For extended exercises, 
make sure to read [From Python to NumPy](http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/).
